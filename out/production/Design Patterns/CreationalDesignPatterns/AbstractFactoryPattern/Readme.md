# Abstract Factory Pattern
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

## Advantages:
- You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
- You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier 
  to support.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

## Disadvantages:
-  The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
- In some cases, the Abstract Factory pattern may lead to a violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle, especially if client code directly depends on concrete factory implementations rather than the abstract interfaces.
- Extending the abstract factory hierarchy or introducing new product families might require modifications to multiple parts of the code, potentially leading to cascading changes and making the system less extensible.
- As you introduce more abstract factories and product families, the number of classes in your system can grow rapidly. This can make the code harder to manage and understand, particularly for smaller projects.

## When to use Abstract Factory Pattern
- Multiple families of related products: When your system needs to be configured with multiple families of related 
products, and you want to ensure that the products from one family are compatible with the products from another family.
- Flexibility and extensibility: If you need to allow for variations or extensions in the products or their families, 
  the Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to introduce new product variants without modifying existing client code.
- Encapsulation of creation logic: The pattern encapsulates the creation of objects, making it easier to change or 
  extend the creation process without affecting the client code.
- Consistency across product families: If you want to enforce consistency among the products created by different 
  factories, the Abstract Factory pattern can help maintain a uniform interface.

## When not to use Abstract Factory Pattern
- The product families are not likely to change: If the products and their families are unlikely to change or be 
extended, using the Abstract Factory pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity.
- Not dealing with multiple families of objects: If your application is not concerned with creating families of 
  related objects and you are dealing with single, independent objects, using the Abstract Factory pattern may be overkill.
- The overhead is too high: In some cases, the overhead of creating and maintaining multiple factories may outweigh 
  the benefits, especially in smaller applications or when there is no need for extensive configurability.
- A simpler solution is sufficient: If a simpler creational pattern, such as the Factory Method or Builder pattern, 
  meets your requirements, there may be no need to introduce the additional complexity of the Abstract Factory pattern.
