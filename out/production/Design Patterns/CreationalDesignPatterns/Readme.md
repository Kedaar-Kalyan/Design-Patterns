# Creational Design Patterns
- Creational Design Patterns abstract the process of instantiating Objects.
- It encapsulates the code for creating objects
- It become more important as system become more complex

There are two main themes that are common to most creational design patterns
1. Encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system should they use
2. Conceal how objects are created and put together

Abstracting this information will makes the code much more flexible
